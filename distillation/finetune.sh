# Guide:
# This script supports distributed training on multi-gpu workers (as well as single-worker training).
# Please set the options below according to the comments.
# For multi-gpu workers training, these options should be manually set for each worker.
# After setting the options, please run the script on each worker.

# Number of GPUs per GPU worker
GPUS_PER_NODE=$(python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.device_count())')

# Number of GPU workers, for single-worker training, please set to 1
NNODES=${NNODES:-1}

# The rank of this worker, should be in {0, ..., WORKER_CNT-1}, for single-worker training, please set to 0
NODE_RANK=${NODE_RANK:-0}

# The ip address of the rank-0 worker, for single-worker training, please set to localhost
MASTER_ADDR=${MASTER_ADDR:-localhost}

# The port for communication
